Knowledge Base Exporter
-----------------------

This is a script that crawl a given Knowledge base and extracts all categories and articles in a formatted JSON file.

The script is aimed to standardized the output of common Knowledge base service.

As for now, only Crisp is working well with this, but a work in progress is being done for the following services:

 * Helpkit
 * Helpscout
 * Intercom
 * Next
 * Notion

Future implementation will be about:

 * Mintlify
 * Freshdesk
 * Any other based on request


We use this internally to import Knowledge Base of our customers onto our service [Fernand](https://getfernand.com).

This script is updated upon import requests we receive.
